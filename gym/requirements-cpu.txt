# Requirements for Gymnasium + MuJoCo (CPU-only)
# 
# RECOMMENDED: Use environment-cpu.yml instead for Windows!
# The conda environment file uses pytorch from conda which is more
# reliable on Windows than pip-installed pytorch.
#
# If you must use pip, install PyTorch FIRST from conda:
#   conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch
# Then install these requirements:
#   pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt

# Core RL packages
gymnasium[mujoco]>=1.0.0
mujoco>=3.0.0

# RL training framework (requires PyTorch - install separately via conda)
stable-baselines3>=2.0.0

# Logging and visualization
tensorboard

# Video recording
imageio
imageio-ffmpeg
